# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms

A simulation of popular process scheduling algorithms used in modern operating systems.

Object-Oriented Style of Programming has been implemented. Containers like multiset and vectors which are part of the Standard Template Library (STL) have been used for optimizing the algorithms. 

The simulation is deterministic i.e, the arrival time and burst time of each process is pre-determined. The user can input the number of processes and the time quantum in case of round robin scheduling. The simulations are performed after which the output is displayed.
The output contains waiting time and turnaround time of each process. It also displays the average waiting and turnaround time for each scheduling algorithm.

Thus, the simulation compares the efficiency of various scheduling algorithms and allows an user to choose the best one among them.
